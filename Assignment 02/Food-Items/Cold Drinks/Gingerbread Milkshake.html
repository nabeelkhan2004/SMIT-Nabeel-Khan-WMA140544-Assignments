            There's something about <b>Gingerbread</b> that feels most appropriate during the holidays. Could it be the warming spices? Or, is it one of those flavors that simply feels festive for no apparent reason? Whatever the case may be, gingerbread flavored foods are everywhere around the holidays, and we've got perhaps the most exciting iteration thus far: a gingerbread milkshake. That's right â€” you get all of the warming flavors of gingerbread, along with the cool, rich creaminess of a milkshake. Sorry, gingerbread cookies, but gingerbread milkshakes may just be the most delicious dessert of the season.
