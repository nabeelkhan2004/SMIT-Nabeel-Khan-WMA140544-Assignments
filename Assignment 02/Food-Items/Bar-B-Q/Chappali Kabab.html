        <b>Chapli Kebab</b> or <b>Chapli Kabab</b> (Pashto: چپلي کباب)[α][β] is a Pashtun-style minced kebab, usually made from ground beef, mutton or chicken with various spices in the shape of a patty. The Chapli Kabab originates from Peshawar in Pakistan.[1][7][3][8] The Peshawari Chapli Kabab is made with beef and is a popular street food throughout South Asia, including Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.<br>
        In India, Chapli Kabab can be found as street food in the cities of Bhopal, Lucknow, Delhi and Hyderabad; where Muslims have a denser population.<br>
        Chapli Kababs are broadly consumed in Dhaka, Bangladesh. But it is most popular during the time of Eid-ul Azha and in ramadan as part of iftar.<br>
        Chapli Kababs can be served and eaten hot with naan or as a bun kebab.
