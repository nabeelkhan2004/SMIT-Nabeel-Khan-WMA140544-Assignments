            <b>Pepperoni Pizza</b> is an American pizza variety which includes one of the country's most beloved toppings. Pepperoni is actually a corrupted form of peperoni (one “p”), which denotes a large pepper in Italian, but nowadays it denotes a spicy salami, usually made with a mixture of beef, pork, and spices.
