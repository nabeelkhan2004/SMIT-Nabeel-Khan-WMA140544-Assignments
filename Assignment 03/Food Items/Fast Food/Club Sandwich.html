            A <b>Club Sandwich</b>, also called a <b>Clubhouse Sandwich</b>, is a sandwich consisting of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.[1][2][3] It is often cut into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.
